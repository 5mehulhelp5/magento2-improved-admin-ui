## Requirements

## Installation
Please install this module via Composer. This module is hosted on [Packagist][packagist].

* `composer require aimes/magento2-improved-admin-ui`
* `bin/magento module:enable Aimes_ImprovedAdminUi`
* `bin/magento setup:upgrade`

## Usage

### Dynamic Replacement
System configuration is provided to set the minimum amount of options required before the component is rendered as a ui-select. By default, this value is set to `20`.

`Stores -> Configuration -> Catalog -> Catalog -> Admin UI`

### Statically Declared UI Components

Not every form has a pool of modifiers, most are statically declared. Since modifying attributes within these forms generally requires a new ui_component file, customisation to additional attributes can be done there. For example:

`view/adminhtml/category_form.xml`
```xml
<!-- some fields -->
<field name="my_custom_attribute"
       component="Aimes_ImprovedAdminUi/js/form/element/ui-select"
       formElement="select">
    <argument name="data" xsi:type="array">
        <item name="config" xsi:type="array">
            <item name="multiple" xsi:type="boolean">false</item>
        </item>
    </argument>
    <settings>
        <elementTmpl>ui/grid/filters/elements/ui-select</elementTmpl>
    </settings>
</field>
<!-- some more fields -->
```

This should be merged with any other desired/required settings. Settings can be found on the default [ui-select component documentation][ui-select-docs].
